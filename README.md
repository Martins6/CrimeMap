# CrimeMap

An app to visualise, map and predict crime statistics. It serves as a Proof of Concept for future web applications for major cities governments and general public interest. It uses data from the City of SÃ£o Paulo.

## Usage or installation

I'm working on estabilishin a link in a server for public use.

But, if you wish to run in your own computer, first clone this repository. Then, you must have R software installed and set the working directory as the folder that you downloaded. Finally, just run the file "app.R". It will automatically install the dependencies.

## Contributing and Future Improvements

Check the project area [here](https://github.com/Martins6/CrimeMap/projects/1), in order to see the plans for the future. This app should focus on risk-related metrics or modelling for crime-analysis. I would be glad to receive any suggestions.

Pull requests are specifically very much welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Otherwise, feel free to tweak and improve it however you want!

## Acknowledgments

This app is from the R community to the world. All the packages that made the app were free and open-source, that is amazing and I'm very thankful. Also, I would like to highlight the [book] "Crime Mapping in R" made by Medina and Solymosi. That book was a real help.
